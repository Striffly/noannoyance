# NoAnnoyance (fork)

This extension is a fork of the original, that adds support for GNOME 45 and 46

## About
Another extension, that removes the 'Window is ready' notification and puts the window into focus.  
In contrast to all the other extensions, this uses ES6 syntax and is actively maintained.

This is a fork of https://github.com/sindex/no-annoyance, so thank you Alex for the work you already made.

## Supported GNOME versions

- 46
